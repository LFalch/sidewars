# Idea

Fighting people with stats (like attack, defence, hp, ranged)

Each side deploys them (not aligned to a grid)
and they try to reach the other side. If a person reaches the end of the map, more control of that zone goes to that player.
Battles end when someone has full control.

Resources of some kind to pay for units to deploy.
